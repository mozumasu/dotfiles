# If anything other than false, fullscreen mode on macOS will not use the
# native fullscreen, but make the window fullscreen without animations and
# using a new space. It's faster than the native fullscreen mode since it
# doesn't use animations.
# 
# Important: tabs DO NOT WORK in this mode. Non-native fullscreen removes
# the titlebar and macOS native tabs require the titlebar. If you use tabs,
# you should not use this mode.
# 
# If you fullscreen a window with tabs, the currently focused tab will
# become fullscreen while the others will remain in a separate window in
# the background. You can switch to that window using normal window-switching
# keybindings such as command+tilde. When you exit fullscreen, the window
# will return to the tabbed state it was in before.
# 
# Allowable values are:
# 
#   * `visible-menu` - Use non-native macOS fullscreen, keep the menu bar visible
#   * `true` - Use non-native macOS fullscreen, hide the menu bar
#   * `false` - Use native macOS fullscreen
# 
# Changing this option at runtime works, but will only apply to the next
# time the window is made fullscreen. If a window is already fullscreen,
# it will retain the previous setting until fullscreen is exited.

# The style of the macOS titlebar. Available values are: "native",
# "transparent", "tabs", and "hidden".
# 
# The "native" style uses the native macOS titlebar with zero customization.
# The titlebar will match your window theme (see `window-theme`).
# 
# The "transparent" style is the same as "native" but the titlebar will
# be transparent and allow your window background color to come through.
# This makes a more seamless window appearance but looks a little less
# typical for a macOS application and may not work well with all themes.
# 
# The "transparent" style will also update in real-time to dynamic
# changes to the window background color, e.g. via OSC 11. To make this
# more aesthetically pleasing, this only happens if the terminal is
# a window, tab, or split that borders the top of the window. This
# avoids a disjointed appearance where the titlebar color changes
# but all the topmost terminals don't match.
# 
# The "tabs" style is a completely custom titlebar that integrates the
# tab bar into the titlebar. This titlebar always matches the background
# color of the terminal. There are some limitations to this style:
# On macOS 13 and below, saved window state will not restore tabs correctly.
# macOS 14 does not have this issue and any other macOS version has not
# been tested.
# 
# The "hidden" style hides the titlebar. Unlike `window-decoration = false`,
# however, it does not remove the frame from the window or cause it to have
# squared corners. Changing to or from this option at run-time may affect
# existing windows in buggy ways.
# 
# When "hidden", the top titlebar area can no longer be used for dragging
# the window. To drag the window, you can use option+click on the resizable
# areas of the frame to drag the window. This is a standard macOS behavior
# and not something Ghostty enables.
# 
# The default value is "transparent". This is an opinionated choice
# but its one I think is the most aesthetically pleasing and works in
# most cases.
# 
# Changing this option at runtime only applies to new windows.

# Whether the proxy icon in the macOS titlebar is visible. The proxy icon
# is the icon that represents the folder of the current working directory.
# You can see this very clearly in the macOS built-in Terminal.app
# titlebar.
# 
# The proxy icon is only visible with the native macOS titlebar style.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * `visible` - Show the proxy icon.
#   * `hidden` - Hide the proxy icon.
# 
# The default value is `visible`.
# 
# This setting can be changed at runtime and will affect all currently
# open windows but only after their working directory changes again.
# Therefore, to make this work after changing the setting, you must
# usually `cd` to a different directory, open a different file in an
# editor, etc.

# macOS doesn't have a distinct "alt" key and instead has the "option"
# key which behaves slightly differently. On macOS by default, the
# option key plus a character will sometimes produces a Unicode character.
# For example, on US standard layouts option-b produces "âˆ«". This may be
# undesirable if you want to use "option" as an "alt" key for keybindings
# in terminal programs or shells.
# 
# This configuration lets you change the behavior so that option is treated
# as alt.
# 
# The default behavior (unset) will depend on your active keyboard
# layout. If your keyboard layout is one of the keyboard layouts listed
# below, then the default value is "true". Otherwise, the default
# value is "false". Keyboard layouts with a default value of "true" are:
# 
#   - U.S. Standard
#   - U.S. International
# 
# Note that if an *Option*-sequence doesn't produce a printable character, it
# will be treated as *Alt* regardless of this setting. (e.g. `alt+ctrl+a`).
# 
# Explicit values that can be set:
# 
# If `true`, the *Option* key will be treated as *Alt*. This makes terminal
# sequences expecting *Alt* to work properly, but will break Unicode input
# sequences on macOS if you use them via the *Alt* key.
# 
# You may set this to `false` to restore the macOS *Alt* key unicode
# sequences but this will break terminal sequences expecting *Alt* to work.
# 
# The values `left` or `right` enable this for the left or right *Option*
# key, respectively.
# 
# This does not work with GLFW builds.

# If true, Ghostty on macOS will automatically enable the "Secure Input"
# feature when it detects that a password prompt is being displayed.
# 
# "Secure Input" is a macOS security feature that prevents applications from
# reading keyboard events. This can always be enabled manually using the
# `Ghostty > Secure Keyboard Entry` menu item.
# 
# Note that automatic password prompt detection is based on heuristics
# and may not always work as expected. Specifically, it does not work
# over SSH connections, but there may be other cases where it also
# doesn't work.
# 
# A reason to disable this feature is if you find that it is interfering
# with legitimate accessibility software (or software that uses the
# accessibility APIs), since secure input prevents any application from
# reading keyboard events.

# is enabled.

# always have secure input enabled, the indication can be distracting and
# you may want to disable it.

# Customize the macOS app icon.
# 
# This only affects the icon that appears in the dock, application
# switcher, etc. This does not affect the icon in Finder because
# that is controlled by a hardcoded value in the signed application
# bundle and can't be changed at runtime. For more details on what
# exactly is affected, see the `NSApplication.icon` Apple documentation;
# that is the API that is being used to set the icon.
# 
# Valid values:
# 
#  * `official` - Use the official Ghostty icon.
#  * `blueprint`, `chalkboard`, `microchip`, `glass`, `holographic`,
#    `paper`, `retro`, `xray` - Official variants of the Ghostty icon
#    hand-created by artists (no AI).
#  * `custom-style` - Use the official Ghostty icon but with custom
#    styles applied to various layers. The custom styles must be
#    specified using the additional `macos-icon`-prefixed configurations.
#    The `macos-icon-ghost-color` and `macos-icon-screen-color`
#    configurations are required for this style.
# 
# WARNING: The `custom-style` option is _experimental_. We may change
# the format of the custom styles in the future. We're still finalizing
# the exact layers and customization options that will be available.
# 
# Other caveats:
# 
#   * The icon in the update dialog will always be the official icon.
#     This is because the update dialog is managed through a
#     separate framework and cannot be customized without significant
#     effort.

# Whether to enable shell integration auto-injection or not. Shell integration
# greatly enhances the terminal experience by enabling a number of features:

# Sets the reporting format for OSC sequences that request color information.
# Ghostty currently supports OSC 10 (foreground), OSC 11 (background), and

# are scaled-up RGB values, where each component are 16 bits. This is how
# most terminals report these values. However, some legacy applications may
# require 8-bit, unscaled, components. We also support turning off reporting
# altogether. The components are lowercase hex values.
# 
# Allowable values are:
# 
#   * `none` - OSC 4/10/11 queries receive no reply
# 
#   * `8-bit` - Color components are return unscaled, e.g. `rr/gg/bb`

# Custom shaders to run after the default shaders. This is a file path
# to a GLSL-syntax shader for all platforms.
# 
# Warning: Invalid shaders can cause Ghostty to become unusable such as by
# causing the window to be completely black. If this happens, you can
# unset this configuration to disable the shader.
# 
# On Linux, this requires OpenGL 4.2. Ghostty typically only requires
# OpenGL 3.3, but custom shaders push that requirement up to 4.2.
# 
# The shader API is identical to the Shadertoy API: you specify a `mainImage`
# function and the available uniforms match Shadertoy. The iChannel0 uniform
# is a texture containing the rendered terminal screen.
# 
# If the shader fails to compile, the shader will be ignored. Any errors
# related to shader compilation will not show up as configuration errors
# and only show up in the log, since shader compilation happens after
# configuration loading on the dedicated render thread.  For interactive
# development, use [shadertoy.com](https://shadertoy.com).
# 
# This can be repeated multiple times to load multiple shaders. The shaders
# will be run in the order they are specified.

# Changing this value at runtime and reloading the configuration will only
# affect new windows, tabs, and splits.

# 
# If this is set to `false`, the terminal and custom shader will only render
# when the terminal is updated. This is more efficient but the shader will
# not animate.
# 
# This can also be set to `always`, which will always run the animation
# loop regardless of whether the terminal is focused or not. The animation
# loop will still only run when custom shaders are used. Note that this
# will use more CPU per terminal surface and can become quite expensive
# depending on the shader and your terminal usage.

# Control the in-app notifications that Ghostty shows.

# 
# Possible notifications are:
# 
#   - `clipboard-copy` (default: true) - Show a notification when text is copied
#     to the clipboard.
# 
# To specify a notification to enable, specify the name of the notification.
# To specify a notification to disable, prefix the name with `no-`. For
# example, to disable `clipboard-copy`, set this configuration to
# `no-clipboard-copy`. To enable it, set this configuration to `clipboard-copy`.
# 
# Multiple notifications can be enabled or disabled by separating them
# with a comma.

# enable all notifications.
